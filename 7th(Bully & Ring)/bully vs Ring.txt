| **Feature**          | **Bully Algorithm**                                                 | **Ring Algorithm**                               |
| -------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------ |
| **Election Process** | Process with highest ID wins, sends messages to higher ID processes | Election message passes sequentially in a ring   |
| **Message Passing**  | Direct messages to processes with higher IDs                        | Sequential passing of election message in a ring |
| **Fault Tolerance**  | Handles dynamic changes well; processes can resume the election     | Fragile if processes fail in the ring            |
| **Scalability**      | Scales but message complexity increases with size                   | Scales efficiently with less message passing     |
| **Time Complexity**  | O(n) (potentially many messages)                                    | O(n) (single round of message passing)           |
| **Use Cases**        | Systems with clear process hierarchy                                | Systems organized in a static ring topology      |
