
✅ How to Demonstrate the Bully Algorithm

🗣️ Start with a Short Explanation:
“This is an implementation of the Bully Algorithm. It is used in distributed systems to elect a coordinator. The process with the highest ID becomes the coordinator. If a lower-ID process finds the coordinator is down, it starts an election.”

🖥️ Demonstration Steps

Step 1: Create Processes
Enter your choice:- 1
Enter the number of processes:- 5
Say: “I’ve created 5 processes: P1 to P5. By default, P5 becomes the coordinator as it has the highest ID.”

Step 2: Display Processes
Enter your choice:- 2
Say: “All processes are currently up and P5 is the coordinator.”

Step 3: Bring Coordinator Down
Enter your choice:- 4
Enter the process number to down:- 5
Say: “Now I’m bringing down process P5 (the coordinator).”

Step 4: Start Election from a Lower Process
Enter your choice:- 5
Enter the process number which will perform election:- 1
Say: “Process P1 notices the coordinator is down, so it initiates an election. Messages are sent to higher-ID processes until a live one responds.”

Step 5: Display Final Status
Enter your choice:- 2
Say: “The election completes and the highest up process becomes the new coordinator — here, P4.”

🧠 Extra Tips to Impress Examiner
- Explain steps aloud as you do them.
- Emphasize: “The highest alive ID wins the election.”
- If asked why it’s called Bully, say:
  “Because the highest ID process bullies others and takes control as coordinator.”

⚠️ Handling Errors / Confusion
If the output is cluttered:
- Say: “Let me re-run that step for clarity.”
- Clear the screen (cls) if needed.
- Always display current status using choice 2.
